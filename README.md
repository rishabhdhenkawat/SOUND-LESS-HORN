# SOUND-LESS-HORN


## Abstract 
Noise pollution is the major concern that has been
disturbing and harming the activity or balance of human life
for ages and if not controlled can lead to serious consequences.
Unwanted sound (noise) can damage psychological health.
Noise pollution can also cause hypertension, high stress levels,
hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other harmful effects. The
purpose of this document is to present an overview into
overcoming the problems occurred by the excess noise
pollution that is caused by an alarming increase of vehicles
that create sound pollution by honking. By implementing
soundless horn drivers can communicate signals and transfer
soundless horn from one vehicle to another. The need of a honk
arises when a driver wants to communicate to another driver
regarding the overtaking he is about to make and that he
needs some space to overtake or to notify some obstacle on his
way and thereby clearing the path for him. Soundless horn
makes use of ad-hoc network to transfer wireless data that
will notify all the drivers about the indications or signals
which they use to convey each-other just like the way horn
works. Soundless horn would produce vibrations that would
vibrate the device attached to the steering of the vehicle which
would notify him the same way a horn notifies a driver about
any movement. Since only a notification is required to alert
drivers during driving, using a soundless horn would thereby
help decrease the level of pollution caused due to unwanted
honking of vehicles.

## INTRODUCTION
Noise pollution one of the major cause of pollution has seen
a rapid increase in the levels of pollution due to the increase
in use of vehicles all over the world and is tending to be a
one of the major concern that needs to be controlled by the
human being apart from other polluting factors. Noise
pollution created by vehicles can lead to various disorders in
human beings and it could also harm human health
drastically. Horn in vehicles are just used for alerting
neighboring drivers and pedestrians so a different approach
was drastically needed to minimize the level of pollution
created by the use horns all over the world. The use of
soundless horn can be implemented in all vehicles in order
to reduce the increasing levels of sound pollutions created
by the increasing vehicles day by day.
Soundless horns would make use of ad-hoc networks to
transmit data packets from one vehicle to other while
driving through road or highways. Using this technology a
little or no sound pollution would be created. The technology
used makes use of cluster based routing protocol that is used
to make stable topology of unsteady vehicular networks.

#### LITERATURE SURVEY


Vehicular Ad-hoc network or VANET were earlier introduced
in 2001 under "car-to-car ad hoc mobile communication and
networking" applications as a means to use technology for
safer driving and decrease the accident caused by vehicles.
Hence the use of this technology can also be used to
overcome sound pollution caused by vehicles over the ages
by using certain mechanism. This paper concentrates on the
use of VANET protocol to exchange horn signals sent by
drivers across the roads or vehicles as means of using horn
to alert drivers in the vicinity.


#### WORKING

VANETs follow the IEEE 802.11p standards assigned to
Wireless Ad Hoc Vehicular Environment. Vehicle Ad-hoc
network also known as VANET works on different protocols
to transmit data from one node to another. Of all of the
protocols that can be used effectively for communication
Clustering based routing protocol (CBRP) is best suited of
Vehicular Ad-hoc network communication.
The advantage Clustering based routing protocol has over
other protocols is that it helps to reduce the overhead
involved in the network and delay of the network. And it also
helps to increase the safety of the vehicles and it increases
the packet delivery ratio. Cluster based routing protocol
basically divides the vehicle into an overlapping (or nonoverlapping in some of the cases) clusters that communicate
with each other and increases the scalability of the network.

In cluster based routing protocol a group of overlapping
clusters forms a disjoint wireless network. Every cluster has
its own cluster head, who helps maintains cluster formation
by communicating with other nodes within the cluster range.
In this process a node with a lowest ID is elected as a cluster
head amongst all the nodes. Each node maintains its own set
of table neighbor table and stores all the necessary details
such as Neighbor ID, Cluster role in a node and it status of its
link. The neighbor table is updated at each hello message
which are broadcasted at a regular interval. Two Cluster
head can inter-communicate with each other with the help of
a special node known as the Gateway node.

Communication with the help of Cluster based routing
protocol, a lot of efficiency is achieved as compared to
communicating with other protocols and it also is not much
expensive to be implemented. CBRT overcomes various
restrictions such as longer coverage area, less loss of packets
while transmitting data, great strength etc. [3]
Following are the features advantages and disadvantages of
CBRT protocol:


#### ADVANTAGES:
a) Minimize route discovery traffic and routing overhead.
b) Uses “local repair” mechanism to reduce delay and new
route discovery traffic.
c) Increases the packet delivery ratio.
DISADVANTAGES:
a) When increases cluster size, overhead on packet must be
increases.
b) The transmission time increases when cluster size
increases.
c) Communication complexity is increased.


##### 1. IMPLEMENTATION OF SOUNDLESS HORN IN ADHOC NETWORK
Due to tremendous rise of noise pollution over the past years
steps should be taken to control the level of pollution made
by the honking of vehicles, which lead to the rise of
soundless horn system, a system that works normally like
the regular horns that are present all over the world but with
different approach. Soundless horns would make use of Adhoc network or also known as VANET networks which
exchanges wireless packets between different nodes based
on cluster based routing protocol to transfer information
from one vehicle to another. Each vehicle would contain OBU
(On-Board Unit) i.e. a pair of transmitting and receiving
device that would help transmitting and receiving the
transmitted signal to and fro.

Vehicles would transmit signals using the onboard circuits
with the help of wireless Ad-hoc networks. These signals
would be carried away along the road and received by the
vehicle with the nearest range. Vehicles which would receive
the signals which would notify the fellow driver with the
help of a device which would be setup on the driver’s
steering wheel.

The device which would be setup at driver’s steering wheel
would comprise of a pair of vibrator that would vibrate
when the receiver receives the signals placed at equidistance
on left and right hand side of the vehicle. The signal which is
received can be used instead of horn as the basic need of the
horn is to alert all the drivers of the moves he is about to
make.
The driver would also be notified by the orange color
ambient light that is placed on both the sides of the steering
wheel followed by vibrations on the steering wheel as shown
below in the image.
An ambient light on the left side followed by a single
vibration would notify of a single driver honking behind
from the left side. Two ambient light on the left side followed
by two vibrations would notify of two drivers honking from
behind and so on.
Same applies with the right side of the steering wheel. The
max no of indicators present on board would only be 3:3
each. In case of the sound produced by horn the vibrator and
the ambient light together does the work of alert made by
the sound for notifying drivers.

An ambient light on center top of steering wheel indicates
that another driver is honking from the front side, in
opposite direction, and a low intensity sound will alert the
driver about the vehicle coming from the opposite side. This
can be useful in situations where vehicle is taking turn and
driver wants to notify other drivers about his/her presence.
The receivers placed on the both side of the vehicle would
detect the signals direction according to which the vibrator
would vibrate and the ambient light would glow up. Using
this approach we can thus overcome a certain level of noise
pollution made by the un-necessary honking of vehicles.

##### CONCLUSIONS
Humans for years have now been accustomed to use horns
making sound to notify or alert drivers while driving but by
going the soundless way slowly by slowly noise pollution
can be controlled. Since lately humans have been more
concerned for saving fossil fuels and switching to an ecofriendlier way to use an alternative for day today use a step
must also be taken to tackle the overgrowing problem of
noise pollution that has grown tremendously over the ages
and humans in only way can contribute to stop noise
pollution by slowly switching to an alternative that reduces
the risk of noise pollution.
